- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
            if i need to use life cycle or its methods i would use class component

            componentDidMout()- ran right after a component is mounted
            componentWillUnmount()- ran right before component is unmounted and destroyed
            setState()-sets the state

            extracts component logic into reusable functions    
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
